# Introduction to C

首先推荐一门慕课：[浙江大学 翁恺老师 程序设计入门——C 语言](http://www.icourse163.org/course/ZJU-199001?tid=235001)，在我高考结束的暑假就是看的这门课学习的 C 语言，也是从这里入门的程序设计。

创建这个仓库来写这个我暂时还不清楚是什么的东西的意义在于，把我对于 C 语言暂时还很粗浅的理解落实到纸面上。这不仅能使我再一次地学习 C 语言，从中温故知新、查漏补缺，也能使我在过去几年中作为 C 语言课程的助教所做的工作留下一些实在的东西。此外，更重要的是，这将使我能在做「Introduction to C」这件事上不断迭代、不断进步，不至于一年比一年差。同时，这也能让我从年复一年的重复劳动中得到解脱，让我以一种更方便的形式向每一届新生分享我想要分享的东西。

受限于知识水平，同时也为了降低阅读的门槛，我将采用中文写作；为了锻炼我的英文写作能力，我将同时附上英文翻译。

最后，欢迎各位指出我在这里使用各种语言时的错误，不论是中英语言的还是 C 语言的，以便我及时改正。

At the very beginning, I want to recommend a MOOC, which means a massive open online course, [Zhejiang University, Prof. Weng Kai, Introduction to programming - C programming language](http://www.icourse163.org/course/ZJU-199001?tid=235001) for all of you. In the summer after my college entrance examination, I learned the C programming language through this course, and I also started programming since then.

The significance of creating this repository to write this thing that I don't even know what it is currently is to put my shallow understanding of the C programming language on the paper. This will not only enable me to learn the C programming language again and gain new knowledge, but also will make my experience in the past few years as a teaching assistant for the C programming course leave some real things for me. What's more, this will make me be able to keep to iterate and make progress in doing "introduction to C", not to be worse year by year. Meanwhile, this also allows me to get rid of the repetitive work year after year, let me share what I want to share with freshman every year in a more convenient way.

Limited to my knowledge level and to lower the threshold for reading, I will write in Chinese. And to exercise my English writing ability I will also attach an English version.

Finally, I very welcome readers to point out mistakes I made when using various language here, whether in using Chinese, English or C, so that I can correct them in time.
